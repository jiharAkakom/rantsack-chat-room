# Rantsack Chat Room

Simple chat room functionality using Golang.

Rantsack is a play on the words Rant (speak or shout at length in a wild, impassioned way) and Ransack (go hurriedly through (a place) stealing things and causing damage).

### Running

Install `go`.

Run with `go run MAIN.go`.

Access the chat room by going to `localhost:8080` in a browser.

### To Do

- Store messages in Redis.
- Push change to clients instead of making clients poll.
- Identify messages from different sources.
- Make populating sent messages to new users configurable.
